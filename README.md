## Scraping and Analysis of Business Review Datasets

### Overview:
The widespread use of internet and massive mount of accumulated data present a great opportunity for businesses to analyze these data to improve their services and better cater to the need of the customers. Most of these data, including review data for businesses, from some of most visited web services play a vital role in the longevity and success of the business. 
This project emphasizes that such data may not be readily available for analysis and extraction methods may be used by businesses to extract these data from their sources. Scraping enough data for analytics is vital to generate concrete evidence for generated insights. Similarly, an automated pipeline for data-scraping can greatly reduce manual efforts as well.
A variety of insights can be generated about a business from its customer reviews. Some of the insights that has been included in this project are analyzing customer sentiments and getting satisfaction of customers on a product or services. Examples of Analysis like these can be used by businesses to give better service to their customers. Similarly, advanced implementation of review data may include using review data for robust recommendation systems. Furthermore, proper analysis of user reviews can give a business an edge over their competing counterparts. Hence, we can see clear evidence that proper analysis of review data clearly ties to the success of a business in the future.
This project summarizes a simple structure of data collection, filtering, analysis, and machine learning to give simple but effective insights on business and their services.
